# Front-end Code Generation using Deep Learning

Frontend Code Generation is a deep learning–powered tool that converts UI design images into functional frontend code. It uses a combination of CNNs and RNNs to interpret visual layouts and generate structured HTML/CSS automatically. The project streamlines the design-to-development workflow, helping developers prototype interfaces faster and reduce manual coding time.

The model is served through a Flask-based web interface, allowing users to upload UI screenshots and instantly receive corresponding frontend code for rapid prototyping.
